    //for this subject
    //for each animal, for each feature, what is the rating
    //eventually want to see for each subject, for features that corr w coming to mind, are you faster
    //do differences in speed for dif features between subjects predict how correlated that is w coming to mind
    //problem: faster at rating responses you gave bc know those well?
        //would need to take own responses out and see if correlation still holds?
    //to test this, want dif subjects to be faster at responding to dif things
    //and rate the things they think of differently
    //probs want mostly semi-predictive features, so can have differences between subjects
    //also range in predictiveness so that for single subjects, some are more predictive than others
    //want category with range 

    //To do:
        //tell them to put fingers on keys 1-8 instructions
        //practice round where they see "don't agree" and press correct number

    //Examine how well individual differences in feature relevance predict individual differences in what comes to mind
            //i. Assign participants to a category
            //ii. Ask them to list members of the category as they come to mind
            //iii. To measure relevance of various features, ask them to list 
                  //members of the category that are described by different features as quickly as they can
            //iv. Ask them to rate each item they called to mind in terms of each of these features

            //i. For each participant, does feature relevance predict likelihood of coming to mind?
            //ii. Do differences in feature relevance between participants predict differences in what comes to mind?
