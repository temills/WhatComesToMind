    //TODO
    //bigness predicts what comes to mind
    //do smallness
    //relevant space is biased towards certain features/dimensions
    //take top 3 for each category and take conceptual opposite

    //what features to include (only predictive ones?)
    //how to do opposite features - big/small, big/not big, small/not small
    //ok to have same participant name both ends of feature spectrum? (should be if random order)
    //should do for multiple categories?
    
    //for each participant, do one feature for each category

    /***************************************** Study *********************************************/
    //so far we've shown that the extent to which an item having a certain feature predicts its coming to mind
    //corresponds to how quickly people can name items with those features

    //this shows that features that predict coming to mind are those that are more central to our reps of items

    //we predict people can name objects...
    //more quickly when prompted with a feature that is central to rep of that type of object
    //and less quickly when prompted with the opposite feature

    //some features we don't represent along at any point on the spectrum really, like small or large feet relative to body size
    //for others, certain side of spectrum might be more important, like small or large

    //we've already shown that largeness correlates w coming to mind
    //and we've shown that people name large animals more easily than for features which don't predict coming to mind
    //this study will further clarify this relationship
    //for features which correlate with coming to mind, we should see that it's harder to name objects w the opposite feature
    //this relationship holds within a certain feature spectrum
    
    //also expect the difference in ease of response to be proportional to how predictive one end of that feature is of coming to mind

    //ideally want to have a few highly predictive features, as well as some less predictive
    //perhaps some negative correlations as well (so opp feature should be easier to name)
